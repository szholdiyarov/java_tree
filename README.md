# java_tree
This is simple implementation of Tree data structure.

It follows specified contract(can be found in (#class BinaryNodeContract) which states:
1) The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.
2) The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf.
3) The height of a tree is a height of the root.
4) A full binary tree.is a binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two children.
5) A complete binary tree is a binary tree, which is completely filled, with the possible exception of the bottom level, which is filled from left to right.


TODO:
1) check generic reference
2) implement 2 - 5 contracts
3) handle exceptions
